### 1. Waterfall Model:

|**Waterfall Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Sequential, linear software development model.|
|**Phases:** Planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.|
|**Advantages:** Simple, easy to understand, and well-suited for small projects with clear requirements.|
|**Drawbacks:** Lack of flexibility, changes are difficult after the project starts.|

### 2. Agile Model:

|**Agile Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Iterative and incremental model emphasizing flexibility and collaboration.|
|**Principles:** Individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, responding to change.|
|**Testing:** Continuous testing throughout the development cycle.|
|**Advantages:** Adaptability, customer involvement, rapid iterations.|
|**Drawbacks:** Requires active customer involvement, can be challenging for large teams.|

### 3. Scrum Model:

|**Scrum Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Agile framework with roles, events, artifacts, and rules.|
|**Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.|
|**Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.|
|**Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.|
|**Testing:** Integration of testing within each sprint.|
|**Advantages:** Clear roles and responsibilities, improved communication.|
|**Drawbacks:** Requires experienced Scrum Master, may not fit all project types.|

### 4. DevOps Model:

|**DevOps Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Integration of development and operations to improve collaboration and productivity.|
|**Key Practices:** Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure as Code.|
|**Testing:** Automated testing integrated into the continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.|
|**Advantages:** Faster deployment, improved collaboration, automation.|
|**Drawbacks:** Initial setup complexity, cultural changes required.|

### 5. Spiral Model:

|**Spiral Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Iterative model combining elements of both waterfall and prototyping models.|
|**Phases:** Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, Evaluation.|
|**Testing:** Risk-driven testing, with testing occurring throughout the development process.|
|**Advantages:** Risk management, adaptability to changes, incremental development.|
|**Drawbacks:** Complex, may require extensive documentation, time-consuming.|

### 6. RAD Model (Rapid Application Development):

|**RAD Model**|
|---|
|**Overview:** Incremental and iterative model focused on rapid development and quick feedback.|
|**Phases:** Planning, User Design, Rapid Construction, Transition.|
|**Testing:** Parallel testing of components, continuous user feedback.|
|**Advantages:** Quick development, client involvement, early prototypes.|
|**Drawbacks:** Skilled developers needed, may not be suitable for large projects.|
